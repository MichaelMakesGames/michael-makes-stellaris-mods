Adds siege warfare to Stellaris!

Have you wondered how that ecumenopolis feeds itself when you control the skies above it? How does that besieged forge world get all its minerals? This is the mod for you!

When a starbase is controlled by a hostile country, planets need to produce their own resources, otherwise they face gradually worsening resource shortages.

[h1]Resource Shortages[/h1]
If energy, minerals, food, and consumer goods aren't produced or stockpiled locally, the planet will suffer gradually worsening penalties. The penalties are dynamic according to empire and species, so for example, a catalytic empire will suffer alloy production penalties during a food shortage, and their non-lithoid pops will be unhappy. Shortages will worsen slower if some of the local needs are met, so building a few farms can help even if not fully self-sufficient.

Critically, Energy and Mineral shortages increase the damage from orbital bombardment, which means those planets will surrender more quickly (or turn into Tomb worlds if facing Armageddon bombardment).

[h1]Stockpiles[/h1]
You can budget some of your resource income to be transferred to local planet stockpiles. During a siege, planets will consume any deficits from their stockpiles, and only face shortages once the stockpile is empty. Planets stockpiles are intelligently prioritized by the following:

[list]
  [*] Population
  [*] Local needs and production
  [*] How long the current stockpile would last in a siege
  [*] And proximity to a war front
[/list]

If you ever need more control, you can manually transfer to/from the local stockpile.

A planet can only stockpile so much! The maximum is determined by +100/300/500/1000 from planet capital tier (+2000/5000/10000 for higher tier modded capitals supported, using [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2807759164]the Merger of Rules[/url] is highly recommended), and +500 (+1000 with tech construction templates) per resource silo. Finally, a good use for resource silos! (Modded resource silos from the follow mods are supported, providing 1/10 of their country capacity as local capacity: see supported mods below in the Compatibility section.)

[h1]Strategic Implications[/h1]
[list]
 [*] Specialized planets may be more efficient, but they are fragile to sieges
 [*] Perhaps specializing planets should be reserved for your well-defended core, and outlying planets should be generalist to slow down enemies
 [*] Fortress worlds will greatly benefit from a local resource supplies, or a large stockpile
 [*] Trade planets are vulnerable to sieges because the trade value doesn't count towards any local resource production when under siege
