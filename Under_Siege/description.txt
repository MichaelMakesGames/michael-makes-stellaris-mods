Adds siege warfare to Stellaris! (For 3.8.*)

Have you wondered how that ecumenopolis feeds itself when you control the skies above it? How does that besieged forge world get all its minerals? This is the mod for you!

When a starbase is controlled by a hostile country, planets need to produce their own resources, otherwise they face gradually worsening resource shortages.

[h1]Resource Shortages[/h1]
If energy, minerals, food, and consumer goods aren't produced or stockpiled locally, the planet will suffer gradually worsening penalties. The penalties are dynamic according to empire and species, so for example, a catalytic empire will suffer alloy production penalties during a food shortage, and their non-lithoid pops will be unhappy. Shortages will worsen slower if some of the local needs are met, so building a few farms can help even if not fully self-sufficient.

Critically, Energy and Mineral shortages increase the damage from orbital bombardment, which means those planets will surrender more quickly (or turn into Tomb worlds if facing Armageddon bombardment).

[h1]Stockpiles[/h1]
You can transfer resources from your empire stockpile to local planet stockpiles. When besieged, planets will consume from that stockpile before they start receiving penalties. You can manually add and remove resources from the stockpile as long as the planet is not under siege.


Does that sound like micro-management hell? You can set a budget to automatically stockpile to your highest priority planets, using the same system as the AI. Priority is determined separately for each resource, based on:
[list]
  [*] Population
  [*] Local needs and production
  [*] How long the current stockpile would last in a siege
  [*] And proximity to a war front
[/list]

A planet can only stockpile so much! The maximum is determined by +100/300/500/1000 from planet capital tier, +100 per stronghold, +200 per fortress, and +1000 per resource silo. Finally, a good use for resource silos! 

[h1]Strategic Implications[/h1]
[list]
 [*] Specialized planets may be more efficient, but they are fragile to sieges
 [*] Perhaps specializing planets should be reserved for your well-defended core, and outlying planets should be generalist to slow down enemies
 [*] Fortress worlds will greatly benefit from a local resource supplies, or a large stockpile
 [*] Trade planets are vulnerable to sieges because the trade value doesn't count towards any local resource production when under siege
[/list]

[h1]Compatibility[/h1]
[list]
  [*] For Stellaris 3.8.*
  [*] NOT achievement compatible
  [*] Can be added to an existing game
  [*] Should be compatible with all other mods
  [list]
    [*] Exception: This mod overwrites a few war priority defines, and will have minor conflicts with other mods that do that. StarNet/StarTech is compatible (its changes will take precedence)
