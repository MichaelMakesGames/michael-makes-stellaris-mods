[h1]This mod does nothing on its own![/h1]

This mod makes the AI hyper relay placement logic of [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2815767345]Smarter Hyper Relays: Improved AI (shrimpAI)[/url] available for total conversion mods to use (mod authors: see below for how to integrate). It does not enable construction-ship-less relay building for the AI.

When using a supported total conversion, you just need to enable that mod and this mod. Load order does not matter. Do NOT enable to the independent version of shrimpAI; it will probably cause bugs with the total conversion.

[h1]Supported Total Conversions[/h1]
[list]
  [*] [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2791119024]Star Wars: Legacy of the Old Republic[/url]
  [*] [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2583755721]Star Wars: New Dawn[/url]
[/list]

[h1]Other Compatibility Notes[/h1]
[list]
  [*] For Stellaris 3.14.*
  [*] NOT achievement compatible
  [*] Can be added to an existing game, but works best if the AI has not started building hyper relays yet
  [*] Can be removed from an existing game
[/list]

[h1]Mod Authors: How to Integrate[/h1]
First, you need to define some placeholders.
A scripted trigger:
[code]
shrimpai_active = { always = no }
[/code]
And a script value:
[code]
shrimpai_ai_weight = { base = 0 }
[/code]
Finally, you need to change the ai_weight of your hyper_relay megastructure definition:
[code]
ai_weight = {
  # keep all the ai_weight logic you already have, then add the following below it
  modifier = {
    factor = 0
    shrimpai_active = yes
  }
  modifier = {
    add = value:shrimpai_ai_weight
    shrimpai_active = yes
  }
  # if you want to make changes to weight on top of what shrimpAI's weight, do so here
}
[/code]
If your mod changes what should be considered a gateway or hyper relay (for example, you add a new upgraded hyper relay megastructure, or an additional separate gateway network), some more steps might be needed. Please reach out to discuss!

If you have any questions, please reach out here or in the linked Discord server. And if you integrate this mod with your total conversion, please let me know so I can add it to the list of supported conversions!
