Fewer Habitable Planets: 25%

Reduces the number of habitable planets from unique and randomly generated systems to 25%. Why not just use the 0.25x Habitable Worlds slider? Well, it doesn't actually work... Even accounting for unique systems and starting systems, the 0.25x setting produces twice as many planets as it should.

Number of uncolonized habitable planets in a huge galaxy, not counting Guaranteed Habitable Worlds or Holy Worlds:
[list]
  [*] Vanilla 1x Habitable Worlds: 190
	[*] Vanilla 0.25x Habitable Worlds: 109 (57% of vanilla 1x)
	[*] This Mod 1x Habitable Worlds: 50 (26% of vanilla 1x)
[/list]

What makes this mod different than others that "do the same thing"?
[list]
  [*] Most other mods change galaxy generation settings, which has the same issues as the 0.25x setting. This mod uses events for a more accurate reduction, and greater compatibility with galaxy generation mods
  [*] This mod also reduces the spawn chance of unique systems containing habitable planets, which others do not change

  [*] Broadly compatible with other mods that change galaxy generation. Place this mod near the top of your load order so other mods can overwrite my changes (I overwrite event distar.290 and many files in common/solar_system_initializers)
  [*] If you are using any mods that add special solar systems (such as Gigastructural Engineering, Planetary Diversity, or More Events Mod), I recommend using [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2807759164]the Merger of Rules[/url]
