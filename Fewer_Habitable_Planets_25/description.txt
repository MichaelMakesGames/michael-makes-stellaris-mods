Fewer Habitable Planets: 0.25x

Reduces the number of habitable planets from unique and randomly generated systems to 0.25x. Why not just use the 0.25x Habitable Worlds slider? Well, it doesn't actually work... Even accounting for unique systems and starting systems, the 0.25x setting produces twice as many planets as it should.

Number of uncolonized habitable planets in a huge galaxy, with Guaranteed Habitable Worlds off (averaged across 5 galaxies):
[list]
  [*] Vanilla 1x Habitable Worlds: 188
  [*] Vanilla 0.25x Habitable Worlds: 106 (56% of vanilla 1x)
  [*] This Mod 1x Habitable Worlds: 46 (24% of vanilla 1x)
  [*] This Mod 0.25x Habitable Worlds: 24 (13% of vanilla 1x, 23% of vanilla 0.25x)
[/list]

What makes this mod different than others that "do the same thing"?
[list]
  [*] Most other mods change galaxy generation settings, which has the same issues as the 0.25x setting. This mod uses events for a more accurate reduction, and greater compatibility with galaxy generation mods
  [*] This mod also reduces the spawn chance of unique systems containing habitable planets, which others do not change
