Submod for [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2815767345]Smarter Hyper Relays: Improved AI (shrimpAI)[/url]. Load order does not matter. Without the shrimpAI base mod, this submod does nothing.

Makes hyper relays cheaper.

Before:
Alloys: 500
Rare Crystals: 100
Influence: 25

After:
Alloys: 500
Rare Crystals: 50
Influence: 10

This matches the values in Sparsity, but Sparsity is not required. Also to note: the shrimpAI base mod is compatible with Sparsity, but will use the vanilla hyper relay costs if this submod is not used.
